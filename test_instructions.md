# Testing Instructions for Authentication Fix

## The Issue That Was Fixed:
- "Invalid Credentials" error when logging in with a created account after app restart
- Accounts not persisting properly across app sessions

## Fixes Implemented:

### 1. **Input Sanitization**
- Added `.trim()` to all email and password inputs
- Prevents whitespace issues that could cause login failures

### 2. **Improved Data Validation**
- Added null checks and safe string conversion
- Better error handling with try-catch blocks
- Case-insensitive email comparison for duplicate checking

### 3. **Auto-Login Feature**
- Added splash screen that checks for saved credentials
- Automatically logs in users if "Remember Me" was checked
- Validates saved credentials against stored user data

### 4. **Debug Features**
- Added debug button to view stored users
- Console logging to track data storage and retrieval
- Clear all users option for testing

## How to Test:

### Test 1: Basic Signup and Login
1. Run the app
2. Go to Sign Up page
3. Create an account with:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Password: "password123"
4. After successful signup, try logging in immediately
5. Should work without "Invalid Credentials" error

### Test 2: App Restart Persistence
1. Create an account as above
2. Close and restart the app completely
3. Try logging in with the same credentials
4. Should work without "Invalid Credentials" error

### Test 3: Remember Me Feature
1. Login with an existing account
2. Check "Remember Me" checkbox
3. Login successfully
4. Close and restart the app
5. Should automatically login without showing login screen

### Test 4: Debug Features
1. After logging in, click the bug icon in the app bar
2. Should show all stored users
3. Can clear all users for fresh testing

## Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Accounts persist across app restarts
- ✅ Login works immediately after signup
- ✅ "Remember Me" enables auto-login
- ✅ No more "Invalid Credentials" for valid accounts
- ✅ Proper handling of whitespace in inputs
- ✅ Debug tools for troubleshooting
