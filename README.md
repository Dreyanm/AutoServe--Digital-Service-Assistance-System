# AUTOSERVE: A WEB-BASED DIGITAL SERVICE ASSISTANCE SYSTEM FOR GLORYMAR BEACH RESORT

GloryMar Beach resorts located at Pagkilatan, Batangas City boasts a land area of 7,800 square meters with multiple amenities such as swimming pools, parking spaces, kayaking, and buffet meals. As time progresses, the resort is consistently expanding its services to enhance guest experience and accommodation..But as more guests coming to enjoy its offers, managing service requests and maintaining guest support has become more challenging. This project introduces AutoServe, a digital service assistance system designed to make guest-staff communication easier, faster, and more efficient.

The app allows guests to submit service requests, chat with staff in real time, track the status of their concerns, and even rate services all from their smartphones. On the staff side, it provides a central platform to manage tickets, schedule tasks, and monitor performance.The system not only reduces response times but also helps prevent service lapses.

With this project, the team aims to elevate the guest experience, lessen the workload on resort staff, and bring smart technology into everyday resort operations. Lastly, it’s about helping the resort continue delivering the unforgettable experiences guests have come to expect—now with the support of a smarter, more responsive system.
